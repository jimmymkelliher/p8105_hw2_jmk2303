# Problem 1

## Cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel Dataset

Let’s talk about trash! We first read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel
dataset, courtesy of HealthyHarbor.

``` r
# read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset
mrTrashData <-
  # pull in the data from Excel, omitting non-data entries
  readxl::read_excel(
        path  = "datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx"
      , sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel"
      , range = "A2:N534" # omit the "Grand Total" row
  ) %>% 
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # remove rows that aggregate daily data to monthly summaries
  drop_na("dumpster") %>%
  # round number sports balls to the nearest integer
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer( # convert vector to integer vector
    round(sports_balls, 0)          # round values to zero decimal places
  ))

# output head of data
head(mrTrashData)
```

## Cleaning the Precipitation Data for 2018 and 2019

The Trash Wheel Collection dataset also contains data on monthly
precipitation (in inches) since 2015. For simplicity, we consider
precipitation data for years 2018 and 2019.

``` r
# read and clean the precipitation dataset for year 2018
precipData2018 <-
  # pull in the data from Excel, omitting non-data entries
  readxl::read_excel(
        path  = "datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx"
      , sheet = "2018 Precipitation"
      , range = "A2:B14" # omit the annual total in row 15
  ) %>% 
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # add ya column for the year
  mutate(year = 2018)

# read and clean the precipitation dataset for year 2019
precipData2019 <-
  # pull in the data from Excel, omitting non-data entries
  readxl::read_excel(
        path  = "datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx"
      , sheet = "2019 Precipitation"
      , range = "A2:B14" # omit the annual total in row 15
  ) %>% 
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  # add ya column for the year
  mutate(year = 2019)

# combine the datasets
precipDataCombined <-
  bind_rows(
      precipData2018
    , precipData2019
  ) %>%
  # convert month to character
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>% 
  # set year as the leading variable
  relocate(year)

# output head of data
head(precipDataCombined)
```

    ## # A tibble: 6 x 3
    ##    year month    total
    ##   <dbl> <chr>    <dbl>
    ## 1  2018 January   0.94
    ## 2  2018 February  4.8 
    ## 3  2018 March     2.69
    ## 4  2018 April     4.69
    ## 5  2018 May       9.27
    ## 6  2018 June      4.77

## Summarizing the Data

The Mr. Trash Wheel dataset consists of data uniquely identified at the
dumpster level. Because the volume of trash generated each day is
random, there may be multiple dumpsters worth of trash reported on a
single day, or there may be no dumpsters worth of trash reported for
weeks at a time. Thus, while we have the date that each dumpter worth of
trash was collected, we should not think of these as time series data.
Data were collected from 2014 to 2021 over a period of 79 months. A
total of 453 dumpsters were collected during this time, implying an
average monthly collection of about 5.73 dumpsters worth of trash. In
2019 alone, Mr. Trash Wheel collected 200 tons of trash, including
116,000 plastic bottles, 329,000 cigarette butts, and 35,000 grocery
bags. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 was 9.

The precipitation dataset is much more straightforward: total
precipitation in inches is reported for each month between 2018 and
2019; that is, there are 24 in the combined dataset. The total
precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches, and the total precipitation for
2019 was 33.95 inches. Analogously, the average monthly precipitation in
2018 was 5.86 inches, and the average monthly precipitation for 2019 was
2.83 inches. Thus, Mr. Trash Wheel enjoyed a much less rainy year in
2019, with annual precipitation down by 51.73%!
