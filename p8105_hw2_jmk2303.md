# Problem 1

## Cleaning the Mr. Trash Wheel Dataset

Let’s talk about trash! We first read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel
dataset, courtesy of HealthyHarbor.

``` r
# read and clean the Mr. Trash Wheel dataset
mrTrashData <-
  # pull in the data from Excel, omitting non-data entries
  readxl::read_excel(
        path  = "datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx"
      , sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel"
      , range = "A2:N534" # omit the "Grand Total" row
  ) %>%
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # remove rows that aggregate daily data to monthly summaries
  drop_na("dumpster") %>%
  # round number sports balls to the nearest integer
  mutate(sports_balls = as.integer( # convert vector to integer vector
    round(sports_balls, 0)          # round values to zero decimal places
  ))

# output head of data
head(mrTrashData, 10) %>% knitr::kable()
```

## Cleaning the Precipitation Data for 2018 and 2019

The Trash Wheel Collection dataset also contains data on monthly
precipitation (in inches) since 2015. For simplicity, we consider
precipitation data for years 2018 and 2019.

``` r
# read and clean the precipitation dataset for year 2018
precipData2018 <-
  # pull in the data from Excel, omitting non-data entries
  readxl::read_excel(
        path  = "datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx"
      , sheet = "2018 Precipitation"
      , range = "A2:B14" # omit the annual total in row 15
  ) %>%
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # add ya column for the year
  mutate(year = 2018)

# read and clean the precipitation dataset for year 2019
precipData2019 <-
  # pull in the data from Excel, omitting non-data entries
  readxl::read_excel(
        path  = "datasets/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-7-2020-2.xlsx"
      , sheet = "2019 Precipitation"
      , range = "A2:B14" # omit the annual total in row 15
  ) %>% 
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # add ya column for the year
  mutate(year = 2019)

# combine the datasets
precipDataCombined <-
  bind_rows(
      precipData2018
    , precipData2019
  ) %>%
  # convert month to character
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
  # set year as the leading variable
  relocate(year)

# output head of data
head(precipDataCombined, 10) %>% knitr::kable()
```

| year | month     | total |
|-----:|:----------|------:|
| 2018 | January   |  0.94 |
| 2018 | February  |  4.80 |
| 2018 | March     |  2.69 |
| 2018 | April     |  4.69 |
| 2018 | May       |  9.27 |
| 2018 | June      |  4.77 |
| 2018 | July      | 10.20 |
| 2018 | August    |  6.45 |
| 2018 | September | 10.47 |
| 2018 | October   |  2.12 |

## Summarizing the Data

The Mr. Trash Wheel dataset consists of data uniquely identified at the
dumpster level. Because the volume of trash generated each day is
random, there may be multiple dumpsters worth of trash reported on a
single day, or there may be no dumpsters worth of trash reported for
weeks at a time. Thus, while we have the date that each dumpter worth of
trash was collected, we should not think of these as time series data.
Data were collected from 2014 to 2021 over a period of 79 months. A
total of 453 dumpsters were collected during this time, implying an
average monthly collection of about 5.73 dumpsters worth of trash. In
2019 alone, Mr. Trash Wheel collected 200 tons of trash, including
116,000 plastic bottles, 329,000 cigarette butts, and 35,000 grocery
bags. The median number of sports balls in a dumpster in 2019 was 9.

The precipitation dataset is much more straightforward: total
precipitation in inches is reported for each month between 2018 and
2019; that is, there are 24 in the combined dataset. The total
precipitation in 2018 was 70.33 inches, and the total precipitation for
2019 was 33.95 inches. Analogously, the average monthly precipitation in
2018 was 5.86 inches, and the average monthly precipitation for 2019 was
2.83 inches. Thus, Mr. Trash Wheel enjoyed a much less rainy year in
2019, with annual precipitation down by 51.73%!

# Problem 2

## The Monthly Political Affiliation (MPA) Dataset

Let’s begin by importing and cleaning a dataset on political affiliation
over time, courtesy of FiveThirtyEight.

``` r
# read and clean the dataset of political affiliations in government over time
polsData <-
  # pull in the data from CSV
  read_csv("datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # separate month variable into (year, month, day) and convert them to integers
  separate(
      col     = mon
    , into    = c("year", "month", "day")
    , sep     = "-"
    , convert = TRUE # convert new variable to integers
  ) %>% 
  # convert month to character
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
  # create binary president variable
  mutate(president = recode(
        .x  = prez_dem
      , `0` = "gop"
      , `1` = "dem"
  )) %>%
  # remove extraneous variables
  select(-c(prez_dem, prez_gop, day)) %>%
  # order variables such that (year, month, president) lead
  relocate(year, month, president)

# output head of data
head(polsData, 10) %>% knitr::kable()
```

| year | month     | president | gov\_gop | sen\_gop | rep\_gop | gov\_dem | sen\_dem | rep\_dem |
|-----:|:----------|:----------|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|---------:|

| 1947 | March     | dem       |       23 |       51 |      253 |       23 |       45 |      198 |

| 1947 | May       | dem       |       23 |       51 |      253 |       23 |       45 |      198 |
| 1947 | June      | dem       |       23 |       51 |      253 |       23 |       45 |      198 |
| 1947 | July      | dem       |       23 |       51 |      253 |       23 |       45 |      198 |
| 1947 | August    | dem       |       23 |       51 |      253 |       23 |       45 |      198 |
| 1947 | September | dem       |       23 |       51 |      253 |       23 |       45 |      198 |
| 1947 | October   | dem       |       23 |       51 |      253 |       23 |       45 |      198 |

The 822 observations in the MPA dataset are uniquely identified by the
`year` and `month` variables, and the other 7 variables in the dataset
consist of counts of national politicians by party affiliation (at
least, for the two major political parties in the US). The data are
reported at a monthly frequency from 1947 to 2015. The variable
`president` is binary and indicates whether the sitting president
identified as a Democrat or a Republican. Because there can only be one
president in a given month, it makes sense for `president` to be binary.
Other variables count the number of governors, senators, and
representatives by political party in a given month.

## The S&P 500 Dataset

We now import and clean monthly data on the closing price of the S&P 500
Index.

``` r
# read and clean the S&P 500 dataset
snpData <-
  read_csv("datasets/snp.csv") %>%
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # separate date variable into (month, day, year) and convert them to integers
  separate(
      col     = date
    , into    = c("month", "day", "year")
    , sep     = "/"
    , convert = TRUE # convert new variable to integers
  ) %>%
  # append century to year
  mutate(year = as.integer(
      year + 1900 + (year < 50) * 100 # note: this will not work on and after year 2050
  )) %>%
  # arrange observations according to (year, month) before month is converted
  arrange(year, month) %>%
  # convert month to character
  mutate(month = month.name[month]) %>%
  # remove extraneous variables
  select(-day) %>%
  # order variables such that (year, month) lead
  relocate(year, month)

# output head of data
head(snpData, 10) %>% knitr::kable()
```

| year | month     | close |
|-----:|:----------|------:|
| 1950 | January   | 17.05 |
| 1950 | February  | 17.22 |
| 1950 | March     | 17.29 |
| 1950 | April     | 17.96 |
| 1950 | May       | 18.78 |
| 1950 | June      | 17.69 |
| 1950 | July      | 17.84 |
| 1950 | August    | 18.42 |
| 1950 | September | 19.45 |
| 1950 | October   | 19.53 |

The 787 observations in the S&P 500 Index dataset are uniquely
identified by the `year` and `month` variables, and the only other
variable gives the close price of the index in the corresponding month.
The data are reported at a monthly frequency from 1950 to 2015. The
average closing price index during this period was 474.89, but with a
range of 2090.34 and a standard deviation of 545.96, this average is
difficult to interpret meaningfully, especially without any adjustment
for inflation.

## The Unemployment Rate Dataset

We now import and clean monthly data on the national unemployment rate.

``` r
# read and clean the unemployment dataset
unemploymentData <-
  read_csv("datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
  # clean up the variable names
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  # pivot from wide to long format
  pivot_longer(
      cols      = jan:dec
    , names_to  = "month"
    , values_to = "percent_unemployed"
  ) %>%
  # convert year to integer
  mutate(year = as.integer(year)) %>%
  # rename month values to match other datasets
  mutate(month = month.name[
    sapply(month, function(x)             # apply function to each element in month vector
      which(x ==                          # identify corresponding index in month.name
        substr(tolower(month.name), 1, 3) # first three characters of elements in month.name
      )
    )
  ])

# output head of data
head(unemploymentData, 10) %>% knitr::kable()
```

| year | month     | percent\_unemployed |
|-----:|:----------|--------------------:|
| 1948 | January   |                 3.4 |
| 1948 | February  |                 3.8 |
| 1948 | March     |                 4.0 |
| 1948 | April     |                 3.9 |
| 1948 | May       |                 3.5 |
| 1948 | June      |                 3.6 |
| 1948 | July      |                 3.6 |
| 1948 | August    |                 3.9 |
| 1948 | September |                 3.8 |
| 1948 | October   |                 3.7 |

The 816 observations in unemployment rate dataset are uniquely
identified by the `year` and `month` variables, and the only other
variable gives the unemployment rate (as a percentage) itself. The data
are reported at a monthly frequency from 1948 to 2015. The average
unemployment rate during this period was 5.83%, and the standard
deviation of the unemployment rate during this period was 1.65%, which
makes for far less noisy data than the S&P 500 Index dataset.

## The Merged Dataset

With each of our datasets uniquely identified by the pair (year, month),
we are now prepared to merge them all together. Because we are
interested in analyzing the effect of which party is in power on key
macroeconomic variables, we consider a left join of our MPA dataset to
the two macroeconomic datasets.

``` r
# merge the three datasets
merged538Data <-
  # because polsData is our foundation, we employ a left join of polsData to snpData
  left_join(polsData, snpData, by = c("year", "month")) %>%
  # next we merge in unemploymentData, again via a left join
  left_join(unemploymentData, by = c("year", "month"))

# output head of data
head(merged538Data, 10) %>% knitr::kable()
```
